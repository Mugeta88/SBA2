# SBA2

This is a sample website for a fictitous company called Accessible Design Co. This was done for a SBA (Skills Based Assessement). This company is a web design company that can assist with web design for all types of people or organizations.

This web page includes a button called "Start Your Accessible Design Project" that users can click on to start exploring more about how the company can work their ideas for web design. 

It includes some information about the various services provided and also a contact form with a "Submit" button that users can add their information and message for any questions or concerns. 




Reflections:
1) I addressed the issue of trying to submit the "Start Your Accessible Design Project" button where a user with a disability may not be able to see this button. So I added aria-live="polite" to inform the screen reader to state to click on this button. I added role="banner" to the nav bar to assist the screen reader with where the navigation is. I added aria-describedby to assist with the form fields by adding descriptors.


2) I added several media queries in the CSS to to address for users with smaller screens. In the media queries I changed the multiple columns into a single column for the change in screen size and also changed the font size to become smaller to make it easier to read on the smaller screens. 


3) I am starting to use more and more W3 Schools website because it displays information in a very clear, concise manner which makes it easir to consume and understand. Also, I used several times the CSS-Tricks website to try and figure out how to better use the flexbox and grid layouts for this web page.
